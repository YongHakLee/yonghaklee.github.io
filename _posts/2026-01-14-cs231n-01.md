### Nearest Neighbor Classifier

#### Example image classification dataset: CIFAR-10

One popular toy image classification dataset is the [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).
This dataset consists of 60,000 tiny images that are 32 pixels high and wide. Each image is labeled with one of 10 classes.
These 60,000 images are partitioned into a training set of 50,000 images and a test set of 10,000 images.
