## GitHub Alerts

GitHub introduced this syntax to create visually distinct callout blocks. There are 5 types:

```markdown
> [!NOTE]
> Highlights information that users should take into account.

> [!TIP]
> Optional information to help a user be more successful.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Crucial information necessary for users to succeed.

> [!WARNING]
> Critical content demanding immediate user attention due to potential risks.

> [!CAUTION]
> Negative potential consequences of an action.
```
