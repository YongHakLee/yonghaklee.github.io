## Computer Science and Problem Solving

---

- computer programming is solving a problem
- input -> *black box* -> output
- We could use a system called *unary* (also called *base-1)* to count one finger at a time.
- Computers today count using a system called *binary* from the term *binary digit* that  we get a familiar term called *bit* (zero or one: on or off).
- Computers use *base-2* to count. This can be pictured as follows:
```Text
2^2  2^1  2^0
4    2    1
```
- Computers generally use eight bits (also known as a *byte*) to represent a number. For example, `00000101` is the number 5 in *binary*. `11111111` represents the number 255. (128/64/32/16/8/4/2/1)

## ASCII

---

- American Standard Code for Information Interchange
- Letters are represented using ones and zeros, just as numbers.
- The *ASCII* standard was created to map specific letters to specific numbers.
```Text
H  I  !
72 73 33
```
- More about [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII)
- Since binary can only count up to *255* we are limited to the number of characters represented by *ASCII*

---

## Unicode

---

- The *Unicode* standard expanded the number of bits that can be transmitted and understood by computers. Unicode includes not only special characters, but emoji as well. ðŸ¤£ðŸ˜’
- While the pattern of zeros and one is standardized within *Unicode*, each device manufacturer may display each emoji slightly differently than another manufacturer.
- More and more features are being added to the Unicode standard to represent further characters and emoji.
- More about [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode), [emoji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji).
